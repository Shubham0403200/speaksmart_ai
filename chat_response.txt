Would you like me to create a detailed architecture diagram (frontend + backend + API flow) for this platform so you can use it for development / pitching / documentation?
It’ll include data flow from “User speaks → AI evaluates → Feedback + PDF → Email.”


Nice — keeping it completely free & no-login for the first validation round is the smartest way to get fast user feedback. Below is a practical, actionable step-by-step workflow (no fluff) to build the three speaking features, test them with students, and iterate until you’re ready to scale or add paid gates.
1. High-level plan (phases)
1.	Prototype (No-login, fully free) — Build working flows for IELTS / Interview / Conversation using simple front-end pages and serverless endpoints. Store minimal session data only to produce feedback and reports.
2.	Test & Validate with students — Invite your students, collect feedback, measure engagement & quality.
3.	Improve model prompts & UX — Tune evaluation prompts, add example band-9 answers, fix edge cases.
4.	Polish & Prepare to scale — Add optional email (for sending PDF reports), light abuse protections, and analytics. Optionally add login/subscription later.
2. Constraints and ground rules for MVP
•	No auth: all features work without accounts. User can optionally enter email for report delivery (not required).
•	Minimal storage: store only session recordings, evaluation results, and aggregated anonymous metrics (for debugging & improvement). Purge recordings after X days (privacy).
•	Free-tier tools only (or low-cost trial) while testing.
•	Fast feedback loop: text feedback is the priority; TTS for questions can be added later.
3. Minimal tech stack (no auth)
•	Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (single-page per feature)
•	Backend: Next.js API Routes (serverless) or simple Node/Express on Vercel/Render
•	STT (speech → text): OpenAI Whisper API or local Whisper (if you prefer no external costs)
•	LLM evaluation: OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-5 (or GPT-4o) with carefully designed prompts
•	Audio storage (temporary): Cloudinary or S3 (bucket) — keep short retention and auto-delete policy
•	PDF generation: jsPDF server-side or client-side; send as download link
•	Email (optional): SendGrid / Resend / Gmail SMTP only if user enters email
•	Analytics: Google Analytics / PostHog (anonymous)
•	Hosting: Vercel (free tier)
Note: You can do everything locally (no external STT) for full privacy, but Whisper API gives quicker reliable transcription for variety of accents.
4. User flows (detailed per feature)
A — IELTS Speaking flow
1.	Landing page: “Practice IELTS Speaking — Start” (no login).
2.	Step 1: Choose Part (1/2/3) or random. UI shows prompt text and a play button (TTS optional).
3.	Step 2: Student records their answer (record UI: start/stop). Use Web Audio + MediaRecorder → produce .webm/.wav.
4.	Step 3: Frontend uploads audio to backend. Backend calls Whisper → get transcription + confidence.
5.	Step 4: Backend sends transcription + original question + metadata to LLM with a Band-scoring + feedback prompt (see below). LLM returns:
o	Predicted band (e.g., 7.5)
o	Short explanation (strengths)
o	Specific improvement points (pronunciation, cohesion, grammar, lexical resource)
o	A model Band-9 sample answer
o	1–2 YouTube links (optional)
6.	Step 5: Show feedback in UI, let student download PDF summary. Optionally let student retry same question.
B — Job Interview flow
1.	Pre-question form: user optionally enters name, email, job title, preferred language (Hindi/English). No login.
2.	Backend generates 10–15 job-specific questions (prompted from LLM) and sends the first question to UI.
3.	For each question:
o	Student records answer → upload to backend (STT) → LLM evaluates.
o	If answer is “good” (LLM classification) show praise + move to next question.
o	If “bad,” LLM returns corrected model answer, concise rewrite, and improvement tips. UI shows both student transcription and corrected model answer.
4.	After all Qs → final report with strengths/gaps + PDF. Option to receive via email if provided.
C — General Speaking (topic) flow
1.	Pre-form: topic, language, name/email optional.
2.	The model conducts a natural conversation by generating the next question/prompt based on previous student response. This is a chat-like back-and-forth using short-turn evaluation each time (same STT + LLM evaluate loop).
3.	After session ends → final summary + suggestions + downloadable PDF.
5. Backend endpoints (example)
•	POST /api/upload-audio — accepts audio blob, returns transcription (Whisper), stores audio temporarily and returns transcript + session id.
•	POST /api/evaluate-ielts — body: {question, transcript, sessionId, part} → returns band, feedback, band-9 answer, suggestions, related YT links.
•	POST /api/generate-questions — body: {jobTitle, language} → returns list of 10–15 questions.
•	POST /api/evaluate-interview — body: {question, transcript, sessionId, jobTitle} → classification + feedback + corrected answers.
•	GET /api/download-report?sessionId= — returns PDF summary.
•	POST /api/send-report — send report if email provided (optional).
6. Example LLM prompt patterns (very important — tune these)
Below are compact templates you can paste into API calls and iterate.
IELTS evaluation prompt (short)
You are an IELTS examiner. Rate the following spoken response on a 0.0–9.0 band scale across fluency & coherence, lexical resource, grammatical range & accuracy, pronunciation. Output JSON with:
{ "band_overall": 7.5, "reason_short": "...", "strengths": ["..."], "improvements": ["..."], "band9_sample": "..." , "youtube_suggestions": ["url1","url2"] }
Question: <QUESTION>
Transcript: <TRANSCRIPT>
Part: <1|2|3>
Keep response concise and actionable.
Interview evaluation prompt (short)
You are a hiring coach for [JOB_TITLE] interviews. Evaluate the following answer (transcript). Provide:
1) classification: {good|needs_improvement}
2) score 1–10
3) corrected model answer (1–2 short paragraphs)
4) 3 bullet tips to improve
Output JSON only.
Transcript: <TRANSCRIPT>
Question: <QUESTION>
Language: <English/Hindi>
Conversation/lesson prompt (short)
Act as a patient conversation partner in <LANG>. User answered: <TRANSCRIPT>. Provide:
- short feedback (1–2 lines)
- 1 follow-up question to continue conversation
- 2 improvement tips
Output JSON.
7. Frontend UX notes (no-login friendly)
•	Keep UI minimal: big record button, discard and retry, progress bar for interviews.
•	Show transcript immediately so student can see what AI heard. If STT confidence is low, show “We’re not confident about some words — retry?”
•	Allow downloading PDF immediately after session (no email required).
•	Option: add a lightweight share button so students can share their PDF on WhatsApp — great organic growth.
•	Add a short feedback widget: “Was this feedback helpful? 👍 / 👎” (no login) — collect anonymous counts.
8. Storage & privacy rules
•	Store audio & transcripts only for the minimum required period (e.g., 7 days) then auto-delete. (Set retention policy on S3/Cloudinary.)
•	If you collect emails, store them separately and provide unsubscribe / deletion on request.
•	Add a simple privacy notice on the landing page explaining data retention & optional email.
9. Testing & quality checks
•	Internal testing: Try many accents (Indian regions) and Hindi-English mixed sentences. Fix transcription fallback rules.
•	Manual QA: Have 10 trusted students record answers; compare LLM banding to human examiner’s band. Note mismatch cases.
•	Metric to track: % of sessions completed, average band predicted, retry rate, PDF download rate, share rate, helpfulness votes.
•	Edge cases: Very quiet audio, background noise, long pauses, non-answers — detect and ask user to retry or offer “Try again” tips.
10. How to bootstrap user testing without login
•	Create a short invite form (Google Form) or link from your existing student groups/YouTube description.
•	Offer incentives: “Free 5 mock checks for the first 200 students.” (still free but urgent)
•	Use WhatsApp/Telegram groups and YouTube cards to drive traffic.
11. Free tools / low-cost options to use initially
•	STT: OpenAI Whisper API (pay-per-use) or local Whisper for no API.
•	LLM: Start with smaller model (cheaper) for evaluation prompts; use stronger model for final feedback.
•	Hosting: Vercel (free)
•	Storage: Cloudinary free tier or S3 free tier
•	Email: Gmail SMTP / SendGrid free tier
•	Analytics: Google Analytics / PostHog
•	PDF: jsPDF (client-side) so users can immediately download without server costs.
12. Metrics you should monitor (to decide “go big”)
•	Daily active users (DAU) / sessions
•	Sessions → Completed (%) (completion funnel)
•	Average session length (seconds)
•	% of students who download the PDF
•	Percentage who share / refer
•	Feedback helpfulness ratio (👍 / total)
•	Model confidence vs manual review mismatches (quality metric)
13. Quick rollout checklist (ready-to-run)
•	Create three front-end pages (IELTS / Interview / Conversation) with record UI
•	Implement STT endpoint & test with varied audios
•	Implement evaluate endpoints with simple LLM prompts (start with basic JSON output)
•	Build PDF generator and in-browser download
•	Add share / feedback buttons (no login)
•	Add a privacy & data retention notice
•	Invite 20 students for alpha testing, log issues, iterate
14. How to improve features (iteration ideas)
•	Add pronunciation scoring + spectrogram visuals later.
•	Use few-shot examples in prompts for more stable band predictions.
•	Add short video tutorials for top errors and attach to PDF.
•	Add teacher review mode (paid later) where human teachers can review flagged sessions.
________________________________________
If you want, I can do one of the following next (pick any — I’ll deliver immediately):
•	Draft the exact API payloads & example JSON responses for each endpoint (helpful for devs).
•	Write copy + UI wireframe for the three landing pages (HTML/React components).
•	Create service prompts with few-shot examples for accurate band prediction (copy-paste ready into your LLM calls).
Which of those would you like now?
Excellent — now we’re moving from idea to execution.
Let’s design your IELTS AI Speaking Practice website in clear, phase-wise steps with sub-checklists, so you can track every milestone and make sure nothing slips through.
Because your MVP is free, no login, all 3 IELTS parts in one flow, we’ll treat this as the core module that everything else (Interview + Conversation) will build on.
